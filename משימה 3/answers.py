            - In the question it was remarked to generate a random number in [0, 1], but it was remarked to use random.random as well.
              The function random.random generates a number in [0, 1). The process to fix the problem is pretty complicated and I believe it's not one of the purposes of the question,
              so I chose to ignore the tiny mismatch, hopefully, it is understandable. (It is very unlikly to generate exactly 1 anyway).

def approx_root(x, eps):

        The function recieves a positive real number, x, and epsilon > 0.
        It calculates the approximation of sqrt x up to epsilon, with the aprroach described in the question.
        It returns the series a1, ..., an, and the final approximation value.

        Notes:
            - The way of solving this problem is defintly mathematical and any other aprroach is difinitely out of place.
              Nevertheless, the question requirements state that using sqrt or rasing to the power of 0.5 is not allowed, therefore I will take it as a line which was meant to block mathematic approach.
              (There may be math workarounds to the sqrt issue but i will take this obligation as an order to neglect any mathematic solution to this problem)
            - I will raise to a power of two though, in order to check if reached a valid approximation. I assume that it's allowed, because guessing the right number to square is the purpose of the sqrt obligation (so it seems).
            - A search for a very specific and accurate value to square requires a very good searching algorithm, so i will search a lion in the desert for that.
            - The left border is clearly the previous element in the series a1, ..., an. The right element cannot be tracked mathematically though. we want to determine the right border as quick as possible, because we are
              searching in the vast infinity in that case. Therefore we will use exponential expression to cut that chase to the right border as quick as possible.
            - We want the base of the exponent to be very big, but perhaps not too big on the beginnig and not too small if we have done several iterations already and the numbers climbed high.
              The last number found in the series is the perfect candidate for that.
